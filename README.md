Geospatial Analysis of Health Facility Distribution in Kenya:  A County-Level Assessment

The geographic location of health facilities influences the health acess and health behaviors of individuals in the 
specific geographic area. Because of this there is a direct relation between health facility distribution and resulting health outcomes. 
Data visualization plays a key role in the determination of health facility distribution, identification of underserved areas and in 
informing decision-making on where to establish new health facilities.This project explores the significance of data visualization in 
analysing health facility distribution, focusing on its impact on infant mortality rates. By using available data, health organizations 
can use visualizations to make decisions on where to establish new health facilities as well as what significant health promotion 
strategies to employ.  

This project was completed as part of my Information Visualization class under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Leidig.
